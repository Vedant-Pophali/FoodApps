## About the Project

This application allows users to:

- View a food menu fetched dynamically from the backend.
- Add or remove items from their cart.
- Calculate cart totals in real time.
- Submit orders with customer details (name, address, city, state).
- Store and manage orders in MongoDB via the backend.

The backend is built with Spring Boot, exposing REST APIs. The frontend uses JavaScript and JSX to build a responsive UI that interacts with the backend APIs.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** JavaScript, JSX  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java)  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **API:** RESTful JSON communication  

---

## Features

- Display food menu dynamically from backend  
- Add/remove items to/from cart  
- Calculate cart totals on the fly  
- Submit order with customer details  
- Store and manage orders on backend  

---

## Installation

### Backend Setup

Run the Spring Boot application:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally or remotely, and properly configured in your Spring Boot application properties (`application.properties` or `application.yml`).

Backend server will be available at:  
`http://localhost:8080`

---

### Frontend Setup

The frontend runs on two local ports:

- **Admin panel:** http://localhost:5173  
- **User-facing app:** http://localhost:5174  

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and access the apps via the ports above.

---

### Environment Variables (Optional)

If your backend or database configuration requires environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root of frontend and backend directories accordingly, e.g.,

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-db-name
```

Make sure to update your Spring Boot and frontend config to read these variables as needed.

---

## Usage

- Open the user-facing app at `http://localhost:5174`
- Browse the food menu loaded from the backend.
- Add or remove items in your cart.
- Fill out order details: name, address, city, state.
- Submit your order.
- Backend will process and store your order in MongoDB.
